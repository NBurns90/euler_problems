# Euler Problems + Tests

For this homework I was required to solve the Euler problems in **Ruby**.  Once the problems had been solved tests were written to test the functionality of each created method.

# Tests Run

1. Problem 1
  - Should allow for a range 1 to 100
  - should divide 10 by 5
  - should divide 12 by 3

2. Problem 2
  - UNFINISHED/BROKEN

3. Problem 3
  - UNFINISHED

# To Run The Tests

- Clone the repo using `git@github.com:NBurns90/euler_problems.git`
- Open the file space in **Atom**
- Navigate to the individual problem folder
- To perform the tests type `rspec` in terminal
